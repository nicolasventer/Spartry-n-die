## Spartry'n'die ##

Spartry’n’die is a 2D platform game build in Unity.

It is a ‘Die and retry’ game: each level has an increasing difficulty and the goal is  
- at first to finish each level,
- at second the fastest you can,
- at third with the fewest deaths.

This git contains the ***final version*** of my game.

There are some bonus levels which ask skills or reflexion.  
Some ennemies are going to your last position on the ground.    
You can double-jump, fall from platform and stun enemy in jumping on his head.
